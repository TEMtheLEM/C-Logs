## DISCLAIMERS:
#### About `src/colours.h`:
`src/colours.h` contains a few functions that do not appear within this repository;
that is because these functions are already compiled and contained in `obj/colours.o`. The library used is [`C-Colours`](https://github.com/TEMtheLEM/C-Colours), a library I made under the MPL v2 license.

Note that the version of the library used here may not be up-to-date with the library released in the [`C-Colours`](https://github.com/TEMtheLEM/C-Colours) repository.
#### Development of this library:
This library may or may not be developed for long periods of time. You've been warned if I ever go without developing this for a long period of time.
